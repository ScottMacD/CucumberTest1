# I created 2 test scenarios. That simply navigate through the website and verify both the purchase and a few other items along the way. 
# The test can be run by setting up a Cucumber/Gherkin environment and using the TestRunner to execute the feature file with both scenarios.
# The tags can be used to run each test individually. The first test would need to have the email address altered to be run a 2nd time.
